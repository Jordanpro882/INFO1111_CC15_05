@article{plant-dev,
	abstract = {Summary The use of computational techniques increasingly permeates developmental biology, from the acquisition, processing and analysis of experimental data to the construction of models of organisms. Specifically, models help to untangle the non-intuitive relations between local morphogenetic processes and global patterns and forms. We survey the modeling techniques and selected models that are designed to elucidate plant development in mechanistic terms, with an emphasis on: the history of mathematical and computational approaches to developmental plant biology; the key objectives and methodological aspects of model construction; the diverse mathematical and computational methods related to plant modeling; and the essence of two classes of models, which approach plant morphogenesis from the geometric and molecular perspectives. In the geometric domain, we review models of cell division patterns, phyllotaxis, the form and vascular patterns of leaves, and branching patterns. In the molecular-level domain, we focus on the currently most extensively developed theme: the role of auxin in plant morphogenesis. The review is addressed to both biologists and computational modelers. Contents Summary 549 I. A brief history of plant models 549 II. Modeling as a methodology 550 III.

@article{collective,
	abstract = {Computational models of human collective behavior offer promise in providing quantitative and empirically verifiable accounts of how individual decisions lead to the emergence of group-level organizations. Agent-based models (ABMs) describe interactions among individual agents and their environment, and provide a process-oriented alternative to descriptive mathematical models. Recent ABMs provide compelling accounts of group pattern formation, contagion and cooperation, and can be used to predict, manipulate and improve upon collective behavior. ABMs overcome an assumption that underlies much of cognitive science -- that the individual is the crucial unit of cognition. The alternative advocated here is that individuals participate in collective organizations that they might not understand or even perceive, and that these organizations affect and are affected by individual behavior.},
